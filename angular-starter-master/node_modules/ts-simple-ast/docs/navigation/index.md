## Navigating the AST

Navigating the AST should be simple and straightforward.

I will slowly be adding documentation for this area. Right now, the best way to explore what's implemented is to look at the autocompletion/intellisense results.
If you can't find something that means it's most likely not implemented and you should [open an issue](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-simple-ast/issues) on GitHub.
